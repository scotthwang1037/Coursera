# # Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
# All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.
# ## Part 1
# The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning.
#
# The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.
import pandas as pd

# Import olympics.csv to python
df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

#loop over the documentation
for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2]=='01':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='02':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='03':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1]=='â„–':
        df.rename(columns={col:'#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(') # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0] # the [0] element is the country name (new index)
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3] # the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)

df = df.drop('Totals')
df.head()

# ### Question 0 (Example)
# What is the first country in df?
def answer_zero():
    return df.iloc[0]
answer_zero()

# ### Question 1
# Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?
def answer_one():
    return df['Gold'].idxmax()
answer_one()

# ### Question 2
# Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?
def answer_two():
    return abs(df['Gold'] - df['Gold.1']).idxmax()
answer_two()

# ### Question 3
# Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count?
def answer_three():
    df1 = df.copy()
    df1 = df1[(df1['Gold'] > 0) & (df1['Gold.1'] > 0)]
    df1 = df1.dropna()
    return abs((df1['Gold'] - df1['Gold.1'])/(df1['Gold.2'])).idxmax()
answer_three()

# ### Question 4
# Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.
def answer_four():
    df['Points'] = df['Gold.2']*3 + df['Silver.2']*2 + df['Bronze.2']*1
    return df['Points']
answer_four()

# ## Part 2
# For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov). Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2015/co-est2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.
#
# The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.
#
# ### Question 5
# Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)
census_df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
census_df.head()

def answer_five():
    new_df = census_df.set_index(['STNAME', 'CTYNAME']).count(level='STNAME')
    return new_df['COUNTY'].idxmax()
answer_five()


# ### Question 6
# **Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state**, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use `CENSUS2010POP`.
def answer_six():
    new_df = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50]
    most_populous_counties = new_df.sort_values('CENSUS2010POP', ascending=False).groupby('STNAME').head(3)
    return most_populous_counties.groupby('STNAME').sum().sort_values('CENSUS2010POP', ascending=False).head(3).index.tolist()
answer_six()

# ### Question 7
# Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)
# e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.
def answer_seven():
    df1 = census_df.copy()
    df1 = df1[['STNAME','CTYNAME','POPESTIMATE2010','POPESTIMATE2011','POPESTIMATE2012','POPESTIMATE2013','POPESTIMATE2014','POPESTIMATE2015']]
    df1 = df1[df1['STNAME'] != df1['CTYNAME']]
    df1 = df1.set_index(['CTYNAME'])
    max1 = df1[['POPESTIMATE2010','POPESTIMATE2011','POPESTIMATE2012','POPESTIMATE2013','POPESTIMATE2014','POPESTIMATE2015']].max(axis=1)
    min1 = df1[['POPESTIMATE2010','POPESTIMATE2011','POPESTIMATE2012','POPESTIMATE2013','POPESTIMATE2014','POPESTIMATE2015']].min(axis=1)
    df1['diff'] = max1 - min1
    return df1['diff'].idxmax()
answer_seven()

# ### Question 8
# In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column.
# Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.
def answer_eight():
    df1 = census_df.copy()
    df1 = df1[((df1['REGION'] == 1) | (df1['REGION'] == 2)) & (df1['CTYNAME'] == 'Washington County') & (df1['POPESTIMATE2015'] > df1['POPESTIMATE2014'])]
    df1 = df1[['STNAME','CTYNAME']]
    return df1
answer_eight()
